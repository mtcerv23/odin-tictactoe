How to play (console version):
type playRound(row, column)

GAME LOGIC:
-----------
Player 1 (X) goes first
Choose a row and column (e.g. [1][1], the middle)
Place an X or O
  If there is already an X or O, skip player's turn
  If there are 3 in a row after this, end the game and declare current player the winner
  Switch player turn

DISPLAY:
--------
Print current game board
Print current player's turn

  AFTER A MOVE INPUT:
  -------------
  Update game board object
  Reprint game board
  Print other player's turn
  
  IF 3 IN A ROW:
  --------------
  Print "Player [1/2] wins!"

PLAYER INTERACTION:
-------------------
Only input a move. That's it. Display will tell you whose turn it is.

GAME OBJECT:
------------
Board: array of 3 indices representing 3 rows, each containing an array of 3 indices representing 3 columns, each containing. This creates a 3x3 grid.

Each board[row][column] is a cell that is an object containing two methods: addMark and getValue.

Each cell gets initialized with 0 but can be changed to either X or O by addMark.


OBJECTS:
--------
Gameboard (contains gameboard array)
Players
Game flow

1. Player input module: the outermost interface
  Display and feeding player input into the inner mechanisms
Running the code:
1. Call GameController factory and store in game object.
2. Calling GameController also calls printNewRound inside, which shows initial blank game board
   and that it is player 1's turn.
3. Player types game.playRound(row, column).
   Player gets shown "Player [getActivePlayer.name] places an [getActivePlayer.mark] on [row], [column]"
   Call placeMark(row, column, getActivePlayer().mark);
   Call switchPlayerTurn();
   Call printNewRound(), which calls board.printBoard() and prints "[getActivePlayer().name]'s turn"
